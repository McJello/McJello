# To-Do List

A Rails app that lets users create to-do list items, which they can reorder by dragging and dropping made possible by JavaScript and AJAX.

# Bugs

All functionality is present with one exception.  When items are moved from one list to another they won't save their position until after a page refresh.  Afterwards, they retain their position.
